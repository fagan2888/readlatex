We can start by removing anything whose sum would be greater than the height.
    We can calculate the following function of each reference as
        The product of
            The height of the referred figure
            The sum of
                a penalty for larger images
                for all other refs
                    if refer to the same figure:
                        (a penalty for duplicates + 1) / (distance to figure + 1)           ; Avoid div/0
                    otherwise:
                        1 / (distance to figure + 1)                                        ; avoid div/0
    Then we remove the maximum figure until sum(height) < height of page

Then, we lay each of the figures out evenly across the entire space as follows:
    Calculate total gap := height - sum of ref heights
    Calculate gap := total gap / (n + 1) ;; For n figures there are n + 1 gaps.
    We can define
        y_0 := gap ; starts at the gap
        y_n = y_(n-1) + gap + h_(n-1)
            where h_n is the height of the nth item
    And then add h_n / 2 to each y_n                                                        ; each y means middle not top
    For some number of steps
        Define the possible movement of some reference to be:
            Find the direction := in which y(i) would travel to be closer to ref(i).pos as -1 or 1
            Find the size of the gap in that direction:
                the total distance := y(i + direction) - y(this)
                subtract h(i) / 2 + h(i + direction) / 2
            Multiply the gap by the gap ratio
            If it overshoots the target, set it to the target
        Calculate the possible movements of all the references.
        Find the one with the maximum absolute value.
        Move that picture by that amount.
