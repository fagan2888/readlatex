We can start by removing anything whose sum would be greater than the height.
    We can calculate the following function of each reference as
        The product of
            The height of the referred figure
            The sum of
                1 / a coefficient representing how important nonduplication is
                for all other refs
                    if refer to the same figure:
                        1 / distance to figure
                    otherwise:
                        constant representing how tog et rid of bunchiness / distance to figure
    Then we remove the maximum figure until sum(height) < height of page

We then order them by 


Knowns:
    refrences to figures (the numbers represent )
        r_1, r_2, ... r_b :: N[1,a]

    property:
        {r1, r2, ... r_b} = {1, 2, ... a}
        Note, set equality. So not necessarily the same order, and a not necessarily =b
    reference locations (correspond to references)
        y_0, y_1, ... y_b :: R

Desired output
    set of figure locations
        z_1, z_2, ... z_b

Constraints:
    forall k in [2, b]
        z_k > z_(k-1)
        z_k - z_(k-1) > (h_k + h_(k-1)) / 2
